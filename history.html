      <p>This beutiful breed is really ancient and has it's roots as deep as 4000BC. This Italian breed was really popular among royalties, famous people (like Michelangelo), but also among farmers and normal folk because of its guard dog skills. This dog was originally kept as a guard dog. However, due to their lovely temperament and intelligence they also became popular as pets.</p>
